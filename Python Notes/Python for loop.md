## Python For Loops

### Understanding For Loops

A `for` loop in Python is a control flow statement designed to iterate over a sequence of elements. It provides a structured way to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence. This construct is particularly useful when you need to perform actions on multiple elements within a collection.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a `for` loop in Python is as follows:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # code to be executed for each item
```

* **`item`**: This is a variable that takes on the value of each element in the iterable during each iteration. It's essentially a placeholder for the current item being processed.
* **`iterable`**: Any object that can be iterated over, such as a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or any other collection that supports iteration.

### How For Loops Work

1. **Initialization:** The loop begins by obtaining the first element from the iterable and assigning it to the loop variable (`item` in the syntax).
2. **Condition Check:** The loop checks if there are more elements in the iterable. If there are, it proceeds to the next step.
3. **Code Execution:** The code block within the loop is executed using the current value of the loop variable.
4. **Iteration:** The loop variable is updated to the next element in the iterable, and the process returns to step 2.
5. **Termination:** The loop continues until all elements in the iterable have been processed.

### The `in` Operator

The `in` operator is crucial for `for` loops. It determines whether a value is present within a sequence. In the context of `for` loops, it iterates over each element in the iterable, assigning the current element to the loop variable for each iteration.

### The `range()` Function

The `range()` function is frequently employed with `for` loops to generate sequences of numbers. It's particularly useful for executing a block of code a specific number of times.

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

* **`start`**: The starting value of the sequence (inclusive). Defaults to 0.
* **`stop`**: The ending value of the sequence (exclusive).
* **`step`**: The difference between consecutive numbers in the sequence. Defaults to 1.

### Common Use Cases

* **Iterating over lists:**
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  for num in numbers:
      print(num * 2)
  ```
* **Iterating over strings:**
  ```python
  text = "hello"
  for char in text:
      print(char)
  ```
* **Iterating over tuples:**
  ```python
  coordinates = (10, 20)
  for value in coordinates:
      print(value)
  ```
* **Iterating over dictionaries:**
  ```python
  person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
  for key, value in person.items():
      print(f"{key}: {value}")
  ```
* **Using `range()` for numerical sequences:**
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)  # Prints numbers from 0 to 4
  ```

## Python For Loops: Expanded Star Pattern Examples

### Pattern 1: Right-Angled Triangle

This pattern constructs a right-angled triangle using asterisks. The number of stars in each row progressively increases.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

### Pattern 2: Inverted Right-Angled Triangle

This pattern creates an inverted right-angled triangle by decreasing the number of stars in each subsequent row.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

### Pattern 3: Pyramid

This pattern forms a pyramid shape using asterisks. Spaces are added before each row to align the pyramid.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    print("* " * i, end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
    * 
   ** 
  *** 
 **** 
*****
```

### Pattern 4: Inverted Pyramid

This pattern creates an inverted pyramid shape, similar to the pyramid but with the order reversed.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    print("* " * i, end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
***** 
 **** 
  *** 
   ** 
    * 
```

### Pattern 5: Diamond

This pattern combines the pyramid and inverted pyramid to form a diamond shape.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    print("* " * (2 * i - 1), end="")
    print()
for i in range(rows - 1, 0, -1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    print("* " * (2 * i - 1), end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
    * 
   *** 
  ***** 
 ******* 
*********
 ******* 
  ***** 
   *** 
    * 
```

### Pattern 6: Right-Angled Triangle with Numbers

This pattern constructs a right-angled triangle using numbers, increasing the numbers in each row.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

### Pattern 7: Inverted Right-Angled Triangle with Numbers

This pattern creates an inverted right-angled triangle using numbers, decreasing the numbers in each row.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i, 0, -1):
        print(j, end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
54321
4321
321
21
1
```

### Pattern 8: Full Pyramid with Numbers

This pattern forms a pyramid shape using numbers, increasing the numbers in each row.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
    1 
   1 2 
  1 2 3 
 1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

### Pattern 9: Hollow Square

This pattern creates a hollow square using asterisks.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(rows):
        if i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == rows - 1:
            print("*", end="")
        else:
            print(" ", end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

### Pattern 10: Diamond with Numbers

This pattern combines the diamond shape with numbers, increasing and decreasing the numbers in a symmetrical pattern.

```python
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    for j in range(1, 2 * i - 1, 2):
        print(j, end="")
    print()
for i in range(rows - 1, 0, -1):
    print(" " * (rows - i), end="")
    for j in range(2 * i - 1, 0, -2):
        print(j, end="")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
    1
   3 2 
  5 4 3 
 7 6 5 4 3 
9 8 7 6 5 7 8 9 
 7 6 5 4 3 
  5 4 3 
   3 2 
    1 
```
