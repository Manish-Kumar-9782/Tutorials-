## Python Fundamentals: Keywords, Identifiers, Variables, Expressions, Statements, and Scope

### Keywords and Identifiers

**Keywords** are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names or other identifiers. They form the backbone of the Python language, defining its syntax and structure.

**Examples of keywords:**

```python
import if else for while def class return
```

**Identifiers** are names given to various program elements like variables, functions, classes, etc. They are used to refer to these elements in your code.

**Rules for creating identifiers:**

* Must start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).
* Can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.
* Cannot be a keyword.
* Are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).

**Examples of valid identifiers:**

```python
age, name, student_count, _temp, my_function
```

**Examples of invalid identifiers:**

```python
123name, my#name, class  # Invalid due to various reasons (starting with number, special characters, keyword)
```

**Naming Conventions:**

* Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the identifier.
* Use lowercase with underscores for separating words (snake_case).
* For class names, use CamelCase (first letter of each word capitalized).
* Be consistent in your naming style throughout your code.

### Variables

A **variable** is a named storage location that holds a value. You can think of it as a container that can store different types of data. In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; it's determined dynamically based on the value assigned to it.

**Creating a variable:**

```python
age = 25  # Creating a variable named 'age' and assigning the value 25
name = "Alice"  # Creating a variable named 'name' and assigning the string "Alice"
```

**Using variables in expressions:**

```python
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y
print(sum)  # Output: 15
```

**Updating a variable:**

```python
count = 0
count += 2  # Incrementing count by 2
print(count)  # Output: 2
```

### Expressions

An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a result. It's a fundamental building block of Python code.

**Examples of expressions:**

* `2 + 3` (arithmetic expression)
* `x * y` (arithmetic expression using variables)
* `len("hello")` (function call expression)
* `True and False` (logical expression)

### Statements

A **statement** is a complete instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. It represents an action to be performed. Expressions are often part of statements.

**Examples of statements:**

* `print("Hello, world!")` (print statement)
* `x = 10` (assignment statement)
* `if age >= 18: print("You are an adult")` (conditional statement)
* `for i in range(5): print(i)` (loop statement)

### Scope in Python

**Scope** refers to the region of a program where a variable is accessible. Python has two primary scopes:

* **Global scope:** Variables declared outside of functions have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
* **Local scope:** Variables declared within functions have local scope and are only accessible within that function.

**Indentation and Scope:**
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Variables defined within a code block have local scope.

```python
def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)  # Accessible within the function

x = 20  # Global variable
my_function()
print(x)  # Output: 10 (local x), then 20 (global x)
```

**Scope in Loops and Conditional Statements:**
Variables created within loops or conditional statements have local scope to that block.

```python
for i in range(5):
    count = i  # Local to the loop
    print(count)

print(count)  # Will cause an error outside the loop
```

Understanding scope is essential for writing clean and maintainable Python code. It helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures correct variable usage.

## Python Scope: A Deeper Dive

### Understanding Scope

Scope in Python delineates the region within a program where a variable is recognizable and can be utilized. This concept is fundamental to comprehending how Python manages variable accessibility and lifetime.

### Types of Scope

#### Global Scope

Variables declared outside of any function or class possess global scope. They are accessible from anywhere within the program, including functions and nested blocks. It's generally advisable to use global variables judiciously as excessive reliance can lead to code maintainability issues.

```python
global_variable = 10

def my_function():
    print(global_variable)  # Accessing global variable

my_function()
print(global_variable)
```

#### Local Scope

Variables defined within a function have local scope, meaning they exist only within that function. They are not accessible from outside the function.

```python
def my_function():
    local_variable = 20
    print(local_variable)

my_function()
# print(local_variable)  # This would cause an error as local_variable is not defined here
```

#### Enclosing Scope

In nested functions (functions defined within other functions), there's an additional scope level known as the enclosing scope. Variables defined in the outer function are accessible within the inner function, but not vice versa.

```python
def outer_function():
    outer_variable = 30

    def inner_function():
        print(outer_variable)  # Accessing outer variable

    inner_function()

outer_function()
```

#### Built-in Scope

Python has a built-in scope that contains names for built-in functions and exceptions. These names are accessible from anywhere in your program.

```python
print(len)  # Accessing the built-in len function
```

### Scope and Variable Lifetime

* **Global variables:** Exist throughout the program's execution.
* **Local variables:** Exist only within the function where they are defined and are destroyed when the function returns.
* **Enclosing variables:** Exist within the outer function and are accessible in nested functions until the outer function returns.

### Scope Resolution

Python follows the LEGB rule to determine the scope of a variable:

1. **Local:** Variables defined within the current function.
2. **Enclosing:** Variables defined in enclosing functions.
3. **Global:** Variables defined at the top level of the module.
4. **Built-in:** Built-in names in Python.

When you use a variable name, Python searches for it in these scopes sequentially.

### Implications for Code

* Avoid using global variables excessively as it can make code harder to understand and maintain.
* Use local variables whenever possible to improve code readability and prevent unintended modifications.
* Be aware of scope when dealing with nested functions to avoid naming conflicts.
* Use the `global` keyword with caution to modify global variables from within functions.

Understanding scope is crucial for writing well-structured and maintainable Python code. By carefully considering variable scope, you can prevent errors, improve code readability, and create more robust programs.

## Data Types in Python

### Understanding Data Types

A data type specifies the kind of value a variable can hold in a programming language. It dictates the operations that can be performed on that data. Essentially, it's a classification or categorization of data items. In Python, everything is an object, and data types are classes, with variables being instances of those classes.

**Why are data types essential?**

* **Memory Allocation:** Different data types require different amounts of memory, so specifying the data type helps in efficient memory management.
* **Data Integrity:** By defining data types, we ensure that data is handled correctly, preventing unexpected errors.
* **Operator Overloading:** Different data types support different operators, allowing for appropriate operations.
* **Type Checking:** Data types help in error detection during program execution. Explicit data types can improve code readability and maintainability.

### Built-in Data Types in Python

Python offers several built-in data types to handle different kinds of data.

#### Numeric Data Types

* **int:** Represents integer numbers (whole numbers without decimal points).

  ```python
  x = 10
  print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
  ```

  Used for counting, indexing, and mathematical operations.
* **float:** Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).

  ```python
  y = 3.14
  print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>
  ```

  Used for measurements, calculations involving decimal values.
* **complex:** Represents complex numbers (numbers with a real and imaginary part).

  ```python
  z = 2 + 3j
  print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
  ```

  Used in specific mathematical and scientific computations.

#### Boolean Data Type

* **bool:** Represents boolean values, either True or False.

  ```python
  flag = True
  print(type(flag))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
  ```

  Used for conditional logic and control flow.

#### String Data Type

* **str:** Represents sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (single, double, or triple).

  ```python
  text = "Hello, World!"
  print(type(text))  # Output: <class 'str'>
  ```

  Used for text manipulation, storage, and display.

**Strings in Detail**

A string is an immutable sequence of characters.When a string is created, it's stored in memory as a sequence of characters. Python optimizes string storage to share common substrings, reducing memory usage. It's created by enclosing characters within single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).

**Memory Storage:** Strings are stored in memory as an array of characters. Python internally manages the memory allocation for strings.

**Indexing:** Each character in a string has an index, starting from 0. Negative indices can be used to access characters from the end.

```python
  text = "Python"
  print(text[0])  # Output: P
  print(text[-1])  # Output: n
```

**Looping:** You can iterate over characters in a string using a `for` loop.

```python
  text = "Python"
  for char in text:
      print(char)
```

**String as an Array:** While strings are technically immutable sequences, they can be treated as arrays of characters in many ways:

```python
  text = "Python"
  print(text[2:5])  # Output: tho
```

### **Common String** **Methods**

* **len(string):** Returns the length of the string.

  ```python
  text = "Hello"
  length = len(text)
  print(length)  # Output: 5
  ```
* **string.upper():** Converts the string to uppercase.

  ```python
  text = "hello"
  upper_text = text.upper()
  print(upper_text)  # Output: HELLO
  ```
* **string.lower():** Converts the string to lowercase.

  ```python
  text = "HELLO"
  lower_text = text.lower()
  print(lower_text)  # Output: hello
  ```
* **string.strip():** Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.

  ```python
  text = "  Hello, World!  "
  stripped_text = text.strip()
  print(stripped_text)  # Output: Hello, World!
  ```
* **string.replace(old, new):** Replaces occurrences of `old` with `new` in the string.

  ```python
  text = "Hello, World!"
  new_text = text.replace("World", "Python")
  print(new_text)  # Output: Hello, Python!
  ```
* **string.split(separator):** Splits the string into a list of substrings based on the separator.

  ```python
  text = "apple,banana,cherry"
  fruits = text.split(",")
  print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
  ```
* **string.find(substring):** Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or -1 if not found.

  ```python
  text = "Hello, World!"
  index = text.find("World")
  print(index)  # Output: 7
  ```
* **string.startswith(prefix):** Returns True if the string starts with the specified prefix, otherwise False.

  ```python
  text = "Hello, World!"
  starts_with_hello = text.startswith("Hello")
  print(starts_with_hello)  # Output: True
  ```

  These are just a few examples of the many string methods available in Python.

**Note:** This is just an overview. Python offers a rich set of data types and string methods. For a comprehensive understanding, explore the official Python documentation and practice using these concepts in your code.

  ```

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return Boolean values.

* **And (`and`)**: Returns True if both operands are True.
  ```python
  x = True
  y = True
  print(x and y)  # Output: True
  ```
* **Or (`or`)**: Returns True if at least one operand is True.
  ```python
  x = True

  ```
* **Not (`not`)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.
  ```python
  x = True
  print(not x)  # Output: False
  ```

### Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal in value but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.

* **Is (`is`)**: Returns True if both variables refer to the same object.
  ```python
  x = [1, 2, 3]
  y = x
  print(x is y)  # Output: True
  ```
* **Is not (`is not`)**: Returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object.
  ```python
  x = [1, 2, 3]
  y = [1, 2, 3]
  print(x is not y)  # Output: True
  ```

### Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test whether a value or variable is present in a sequence (like lists, tuples, strings, or sets).

* **In (`in`)**: Returns True if a value is present in the sequence.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  print(2 in my_list)  # Output: True
  ```
* **Not in (`not in`)**: Returns True if a value is not present in the sequence.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  print(4 not in my_list)  # Output: True
  ```

By understanding these operators, you can effectively manipulate data and make decisions within your Python programs.
