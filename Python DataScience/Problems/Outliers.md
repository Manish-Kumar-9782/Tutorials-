# Outliers

- **Outlier Detection** : A practical guide to identify and remove outliers from data using visualizations, algorithms, and statistics. [Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset and can affect the performance of machine learning models]().
- **Why Detect Outliers** : There are two reasons for detecting outliers: to improve the quality of the data and to gain insights from the anomalies. Outliers can be caused by various factors such as errors, inaccuracies, or rare events.
- **How to Detect Outliers** : There are several methods to detect outliers, such as box plots, histograms, scatter plots, z-scores, IQR, DBSCAN, isolation forest, and SVM. Each method has its advantages and limitations and can be applied to different types of data.
- **How to Remove Outliers** : The strategies to remove outliers from the data, such as dropping, capping, imputing, or transforming. The choice of the strategy depends on the nature and impact of the outliers.

### `How to choose the best outlier detection method?`

There is no definitive answer to this question, as different outlier detection methods have different advantages and limitations depending on the type, distribution, and dimensionality of the data, as well as the goal and context of the analysis. However, here are some general steps that can help you choose the best outlier detection method for your problem:

- **Understand your data** : Explore the characteristics of your data, such as the number of features, the range and scale of values, the presence of missing values, the shape of the distribution, and the correlation between features. This will help you narrow down the methods that are suitable for your data type and structure.
- **Define your outliers** : Outliers can be defined in different ways, such as statistical outliers (values that deviate significantly from the mean or median), contextual outliers (values that are abnormal given a specific condition or scenario), or collective outliers (groups of values that are anomalous compared to the rest of the data). You should have a clear definition of what constitutes an outlier in your problem domain and how to measure it.
- **Compare different methods** : Try out different methods that are applicable to your data and outlier definition, and compare their results. You can use visualizations, such as box plots, histograms, or scatter plots, to inspect the detected outliers and their impact on the data distribution. You can also use statistical tests, such as z-scores or interquartile range, to quantify the degree of outlierness and test the significance of the outliers. Some common methods for outlier detection are:
  - **Distance-based methods** : These methods measure the distance or similarity between data points and identify outliers as those that are far away from most of the data. Examples of distance-based methods are k-nearest neighbors, DBSCAN, and isolation forest.
  - **Density-based methods** : These methods estimate the density or frequency of data points in different regions of the feature space and identify outliers as those that belong to low-density regions. Examples of density-based methods are local outlier factor and one-class SVM.
  - **Clustering-based methods** : These methods group data points into clusters based on their similarity or proximity and identify outliers as those that do not belong to any cluster or belong to small or sparse clusters. Examples of clustering-based methods are k-means and hierarchical clustering.
  - **Ensemble-based methods** : These methods combine multiple outlier detection methods and use a voting or ranking scheme to identify outliers based on their agreement or disagreement with different methods. Examples of ensemble-based methods are feature bagging and LSCP.
  - **Evaluate your results** : Evaluate the performance and accuracy of your chosen method using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. You can use external labels or ground truth (if available) to measure the precision, recall, or F1-score of your method. You can also use internal criteria, such as silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index, to measure the quality or stability of your method. Additionally, you can use cross-validation or bootstrap techniques to assess the robustness or generalizability of your method.
