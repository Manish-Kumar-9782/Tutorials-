Learning Points

- Explain the meaning of confidence level, error of estimate, and critical value.
- Find the critical value corresponding to a given confidence level.
- Compute the confidence intervals for ${\mu}$ when ${\sigma}$.
- Compute the sample size to be used for estimating a mean ${\mu}$.

## Point Estimation

An estimate of population parameter given by a single number is called a point estimate for that parameter.

**In other words,** A point estimate of a population parameter is an estimate of the parameter using a single number.

${\bar{x}}$ is the point estimate for ${\mu}$.

`Note:` Even with a large random sample, the value of ${bar{x}}$ usually is not exactly equal to the population mean ${\mu}$.

**Margin of Error:** The margin of error is the magnitude of the difference b/w the sample point estimate and the true population parameter value.

when using the $\bar{x}$ as a point estimate of $\mu$, the **margin of error** is the magnitude of $\bar{x} - \mu$ or $|\bar{x} - \mu|$

`Note: ` We cannot say exactly how close $\bar{x}$ is to $\mu$ is unknown. Therefore, the exact margin of error is unknown when the population parameter is unknown. therefore we need to learn the about the range in which our $\bar{x}$ lies.

**Confidence Level:**\
To estimate the range in which $\bar{x}$ will lies, we must be confident about the estimation. The reliability of an estimate will be measured by the _confidence level_.

Theoretically, we can choose c to be any value between 0 and 1, but usually c is equal to a number such as 0.90, 0.95, 0.99.

**Critical Value:**\
If we have a confidence level value then also we can have a z-score value using the z-score table (on standard normal distribution), that value denoted by $z_c$ and called critical value. This value determines the range of the values in which our point estimate lies.
