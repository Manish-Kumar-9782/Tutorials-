# Java Inheritance: Types and Relationships

In this blog post, we will learn about one of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming: inheritance. Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to reuse the code and functionality of an existing class in a new class. Inheritance also establishes a relationship between classes, such as IS-A and HAS-A. We will see what these relationships mean and how they are implemented in Java.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a process of deriving a new class from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass or a child class, and the existing class is called a superclass or a parent class. The subclass inherits all the properties and methods of the superclass, and can also add its own properties and methods.

Inheritance is useful for code reuse, as we do not have to write the same code again and again for different classes that share some common features. For example, if we have a class called `Animal` that defines some general properties and behaviors of animals, such as `name`, `age`, `eat()`, and `sleep()`, we can create subclasses for specific types of animals, such as `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`, etc., that inherit these properties and behaviors from `Animal`, and also have their own properties and behaviors, such as `breed`, `color`, `bark()`, `meow()`, `fly()`, etc.

Inheritance also helps us to achieve polymorphism, which is the ability of an object to take different forms depending on the context. For example, if we have a reference variable of type `Animal`, it can refer to any object of any subclass of `Animal`, such as `Dog`, `Cat`, or `Bird`. Depending on the actual object that the reference variable points to, the methods that are invoked will be different. For example, if the reference variable points to a `Dog` object, the `eat()` method will be the one defined in the `Dog` class, not the one defined in the `Animal` class.

## How to Implement Inheritance in Java?

In Java, inheritance is implemented using the keyword `extends`. The syntax for creating a subclass from a superclass is:

```java
class Subclass extends Superclass {
  // properties and methods of subclass
}
```

For example, to create a subclass called `Dog` from a superclass called `Animal`, we can write:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
  // properties and methods of Dog
}
```

By using the keyword `extends`, we indicate that the subclass inherits all the properties and methods of the superclass. We can also override or redefine some of the inherited methods in the subclass if we want to change their behavior or functionality. For example, we can override the `eat()` method in the `Dog` class to make it more specific:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
  // properties and methods of Dog

  // overriding the eat() method
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Dog eats bones");
  }
}
```

We can also use the keyword `super` to access the properties and methods of the superclass from the subclass. For example, we can use `super.eat()` to invoke the original `eat()` method defined in the `Animal` class from the `Dog` class. We can also use `super()` to invoke the constructor of the superclass from the constructor of the subclass. For example:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
  // properties and methods of Dog

  // constructor of Dog
  public Dog(String name, int age) {
    // invoking the constructor of Animal
    super(name, age);
    System.out.println("Dog object created");
  }
}
```

## Types of Inheritance in Java

There are different types of inheritance that can be implemented in Java, depending on how many classes are involved and how they are related. The main types of inheritance are:

- Single inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass. This is also known as simple inheritance.
- Multilevel inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass. This is also known as indirect inheritance.
- Hierarchical inheritance: More than one subclass inherits from a single superclass. This is also known as multiple inheritance.
- Hybrid inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes, which means that a subclass cannot inherit from more than one superclass directly. However, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, which means that a class can implement more than one interface.

### Single Inheritance Example

Single inheritance is when a subclass inherits from only one superclass. For example:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal eats");
  }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`. It inherits the `eat()` method from `Animal` and also has its own `bark()` method.

### Multilevel Inheritance Example

Multilevel inheritance is when a subclass inherits from another subclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass. For example:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal eats");
  }
}

// Subclass 1
class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}

// Subclass 2
class Puppy extends Dog {
  public void play() {
    System.out.println("Puppy plays");
  }
}
```

In this example, `Puppy` is a subclass of `Dog`, which is a subclass of `Animal`. It inherits the `eat()` method from `Animal`, the `bark()` method from `Dog`, and also has its own `play()` method.

### Hierarchical Inheritance Example

Hierarchical inheritance is when more than one subclass inherits from a single superclass. For example:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal eats");
  }
}

// Subclass 1
class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}

// Subclass 2
class Cat extends Animal {
  public void meow() {
    System.out.println("Cat meows");
  }
}
```

In this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of `Animal`. They inherit the `eat()` method from `Animal` and also have their own methods.

## IS-A and HAS-A Relationships

IS-A and HAS-A are two ways of expressing the relationship between classes in Java.

### IS-A Relationship

IS-A relationship means that one class is a subtype or a specific form of another class. It is also known as inheritance or generalization. It can be expressed using the keyword `extends` or `implements`. For example:

```java
// IS-A relationship using extends
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Dog is an Animal
}

// IS-A relationship using implements
interface Flyable {
  // Flyable is an interface
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
  // Bird is a Flyable
}
```

### HAS-A Relationship

HAS-A relationship means that one class has a reference or an instance of another class. It is also known as composition or aggregation. It can be expressed using the keyword `new` or by passing an object as a parameter. For example:

```java
// HAS-A relationship using new
class Car {
  // Car has an Engine
  Engine engine = new Engine();
}

// HAS-A relationship using parameter
class House {
  // House has a Bathroom
  Bathroom bathroom;

  public House(Bathroom bathroom) {
    this.bathroom = bathroom;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned about inheritance, types of inheritance, and IS-A and HAS-A relationships in Java. Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows us to reuse the code and functionality of an existing class in a new class. Inheritance also establishes a relationship between classes, such as IS-A and HAS-A. We have seen how to implement inheritance in Java using the keyword `extends` and how to use the keyword `super` to access the properties and methods of the superclass from the subclass. We have also seen some examples of different types of inheritance, such as single, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance. We have also learned how to express IS-A and HAS-A relationships using the keywords `extends`, `implements`, `new`, and parameters.
