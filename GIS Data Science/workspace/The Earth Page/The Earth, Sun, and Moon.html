    <p>Earth, which is our base from which we look into space, is
        constantly moving. Understanding this movement is one of the most
        useful and important things in astronomy.</p>

    <p>The earth orbits the sun in an elliptical orbit and the moon
        orbits the earth with the same kind of orbit. Looking down from
        the north pole, the earth spins in a counterclockwise direction
        on an imaginary line called its axis once every day. This
        accounts for the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in
        the west. The earth�s axis is tilted with respect to the
        plane of its orbit at an angle of about 23.4 degrees. If we
        position ourselves high above the north pole, we would see that
        the earth orbits the sun in a counterclockwise motion, coming to
        the same position among the stars every 365.26 earth days. We
        would also see that the moon also orbits the earth in a
        counterclockwise motion. This is illustrated in the following
        example.</p>

    <p>The average distance from the earth to the sun, the semimajor
        axis of its orbit, is 149,597,890 km. This distance was not known
        until recently and it is called the astronomical unit or AU. The
        distances of the other planets to the sun are usually measured in
        astronomical units.</p>

    <p>Because of the tilt of the earth, not every place on earth
        gets light every day. Also, some places have extremely short days.
    </p>

    <p>As the earth revolves around the sun, the place where light
        shines the brightest changes. This motion gives us the different
        seasons. For instance, the poles receive less light than does the
        equator because of the angle that the land around the poles
        receive the sun�s light. When the north pole is tilted
        toward the sun, the northern hemisphere is presented to the sun
        at a greater angle than the southern hemisphere and the northern
        hemisphere gets warmer. When this happens, the northern
        hemisphere gets summer while the southern hemisphere gets winter.
        When the south pole is tilted toward the sun, the two seasons
        reverse hemispheres. This is illustrated in the following image.</p>

    <p>The earth�s orbit is called the ecliptic. The plane which
        contains the ecliptic is the reference plane for the positions of
        most solar system bodies. Viewed from earth, the ecliptic is the
        apparent motion of the sun among the stars.</p>

    <p>The earth�s equator is a circle going around the earth
        which is on a plane that is perpendicular to the earth�s

                    Equinoxes</strong></em></font>
    </p>

    <p>This equatorial plane is one of the most important in
        astronomy because it intersects the plane of the ecliptic and
        gives us a reference point in space by which we can measure the
        positions of stars. This plane also divides the earth into halves,
        the northern half being the northern hemisphere, the other half
        being the southern hemisphere. The intersection of these planes
        is a line, which for convenience we will call the line of
        equinoxes. The real definition of equinox is the point on the
        celestial sphere which intersects this line, but since the
        celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere with any size, the
        equinoxes are really lines. Also, for some purposes and
        illustrations, it is more convenient to think of the equinoxes as
        a line extending into space. For other purposes, it is convinient
        to think of the equinoxes as directions. The two planes are
        illustrated below.</p>

    <p>One half of this line is called the vernal equinox; the other
        half is called the autumnal equinox. At two points in the earth�s
        orbit this line intersects the sun. These two places mark the
        start of two of the four seasons, autumn or spring. The autumnal
        equinox starts autumn around September 23. From earth, this marks
        the time when the sun looks as if it is crossing the plane of the
        equator on its way south. The vernal equinox starts spring around
        March 21. This marks the time when the sun looks as if it is
        crossing the plane of the equator on its way north. The earth
        carries the plane of the equator along with it. When the sun
        looks as if it is on its way north or south, the earth is
        actually carrying the equatorial plane along so that it crosses
        the sun.</p>

    <p>Perpendicular to this line of equinoxes is a line which
        contains the solstices. The solstices are points on the ecliptic
        which start the other two seasons, summer and winter, when they
        cross the sun. The summer solstice is one half of this line, the
        winter solstice is the other half of this line. The half of this
        line that is north of the celestial equator is the summer
        solstice, the half that is south of the celestial equator is the
        winter solstice. Currently, the winter solstice starts winter for
        the northern hemisphere at about the time the earth is closest to
        the sun. This line is illustrated in the following example.</p>

    <p>Because of centrifugal force involved when an object spins,
        the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is somewhat flattened at
        the poles and bulges out at the equator. The distance from any
        point on the equator to the center of the earth is longer than
        the distance from either pole to the center of the earth. This is
        illustrated in the following image which is exaggerated for
        clarity. The form caused by this equatorial bulge is called a
        geoid.</p>

                    Moon</strong></em></font>
    </p>

    <p>The moon is the earth�s only natural satellite. Its
        average distance from the earth is 384,403 km. Its revolution
        period around the earth is the same length and direction as its
        rotation period, which results in the moon always keeping one
        side turned toward the earth and the other side turned away from
        the earth. This type of motion is called synchronous rotation.
        The side turned away from the earth is called the moon�s
        dark side, even though it is lit half of the time. The moon�s
        sidereal period of revolution is about 27.32 days long. This
        means that a line drawn through the center of the earth and the
        moon would point to the same star every 27.32 days. Due to slight
        variations in the orbital velocity of the moon, over a 30 year
        period, 59% of the moon�s surface is made visible. This is
        known as libration.</p>

    <p>The moon�s orbit is not in the plane of the ecliptic and
        because of the elliptical nature of the moon�s orbit, it is
        not always the same distance from the earth. At the two
        intersections of the moon�s orbit and the plane of the
        ecliptic are two nodes. These nodes regress along the plane of
        the ecliptic, making one complete rotation every 18.61 years. See
        Orbits.</p>

    <p>The moon has a noticeable effect on the earth in the form of
        tides, but it also affects the motion and orbit of the earth. The
        moon does not orbit the center of the earth, rather, they both
        revolve around the center of their masses called the barycenter.
        This is illustrated in the following animation.</p>

    <p>The sun acts on the earth and its moon as one entity with its
        center at the barycenter. Since the earth revolves around the
        barycenter, which in turn orbits the sun, the earth follows a
        wobbly path around the sun. This is illustrated in the following
        example. To complicate things further, the barycenter is not
        always in the same place due to the elliptical nature of the moon�s
        orbit.</p>

    <p>The sun attracts the moon in such a way that it perturbs its
        orbit every 31.807 days, this phenomenon is called evection. The
        moon also changes the position of the earth�s equinoxes. The
        sun and moon each attract the earth�s equatorial bulge,
        trying to bring it into alignment with themselves. This torque is
        counteracted by the rotation of the earth. The combination of
        these two forces is a slow rotation of the earth�s axis,
        which in turn results in a slow westward rotation of the
        equinoxes. Looking down from the north pole, the equinoxes would
        appear to be rotating in a clockwise motion. The equinoxes and
        poles complete a rotation every 25,800 years. The equinoxes move
        at a rate of about 50.27 arc seconds per year. This phenomenon in
        known as the precession of the equinoxes and is illustrated in
        the following image.</p>

    <p>The north pole is currently pointing to a spot near the star
        Polaris. Because the vernal equinox is the starting point for
        most star charts, the charts must be made for a certain period.
        The star charts must be updated periodically to account for this
        movement of the reference point. </p>

    <p>Because of the seasonal changes in the ice, snow, atmospheric
        distribution, and perhaps because of movements in the material
        within the earth, the geographic poles constantly change position
        in relation to the earth�s surface. This phenomenon is known
        as the Chandler wobble. Scientists have resolved the change into
        two almost circular components, the first with a radius of about
        6 meters and a period of 12 months, the second with a radius of 3-15
        meters and a period of about 14 months.</p>

    <p>The sun and moon, because of their varying distances and
        directions in relation to the earth, constantly vary their
        gravitational attractions on the earth. This makes the poles
        wander irregularly by about + or - 9 arc seconds from its average,
        or mean, position. This phenomenon is known as nutation and has a
        period of about 18.6 years. The primary component of this is from
        the moon and is known as lunar nutation.</p>

    <p>The sun and moon also constantly change the earth�s rate
        of spin.</p>

    <p>Star charts use the mean equinox instead of the true equinox
        for their zero points. The mean equinox is the position of the
        equinox corrected for the slight but noticeable changes caused by
        nutation and the Chandler wobble. The mean equinox is still
        affected by precession, however, and does change position, but
        does it at a constant, predictable rate. Scientists requiring up-to-date
        precision information about the position of the earth can use the
        International Earth Rotation Service or IERS. This information
        can be found at the IERS web site at <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/"

    <p>Because of the elliptical nature of the earth�s orbit and
        constant changes in the earth�s rate of spin because of the
        previously mentioned phenomena, the sun, as seen from earth, is
        moving at a non-uniform rate. This makes it difficult to use the
        real position of the sun as a reference for time keeping. For
        these purposes, a point which moves at a constant rate around the
        earth is used instead of the real position of the sun. This point
        is called the mean sun and is the basis for mean solar time.</p>
