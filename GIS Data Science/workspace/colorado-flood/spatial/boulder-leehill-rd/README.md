# About these data

The data in this directory were acquired by the National Ecological Observatory
Network during fortuitous test flights before and after the 2013 Colorado Floods.

DTMs and DSMs were generated by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform data processing team.
Terrain model hillshades and the clip-extent were generated by Leah Wasser at Earth Lab - University of Colorado Boulder.


# Lidar point cloud data subsets

The .las data subsets were generated by Tristan Goulden from the National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as examples of colorized lidar point clouds.


# About the subset

(University of Colorado - Boulder) as a part of the Spring 2017 Earth Analytics
