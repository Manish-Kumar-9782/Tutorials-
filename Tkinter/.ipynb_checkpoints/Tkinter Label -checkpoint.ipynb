So, first we selected our bitmap icon which need to be displayed on the Label then we passed it into tk.PhotoImage(file=path of image) and stored it to logo object. Now this logo object is can be used anywhere in tkinter so we will use it into Label's Imgae attribute which is used to display images or graphics on the label. </li>\n",

So, now we can see the effect of the activebackground effect here we do not need to set this widget state as tk.ACTIVE because it will be in ACTIVE state when it will be pressed. </li>\n",
