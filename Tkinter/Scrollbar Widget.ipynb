    "\n",
    "1. Make a Frame with a proper defined Height and width in the root or a master window.\n",
    "2. Make a scrollbar widget by using the Frame as the master window for the Scrollbar and place it to the desired position. (Assume we have made a Scrollbar named as SB)\n",
    "3. Now make a widget `(master = Frame )`which supports the scrolling like Listbox, We will use the Listbox as an example.\n",
    "4. Connect the Listbox to the Scrollbar (SB) by using any of two commands `(xscrollcommand or yscrollcommand)` and put the values as 'scrollbar.set' (SB.set) in which SB can be assumed the scrollbar and set is the scrollbar method to set it for the Lisbox in y dirction.\n",
    "5. After packing the Listbox we also make to some configuration to the Scrollbar. Here in scrollbar we need to tell it that you are connected to this widget by using the command option, in our case we will give it as `(command = List.yview)`, xview or yview can be slected according to the orientation of the widget and dirction of the scrolling.\n"
