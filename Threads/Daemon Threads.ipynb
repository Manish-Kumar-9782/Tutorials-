    "## Daemon Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Daemon threads is a background service thread which runs as a low priority thread and performs background like garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Daemons threads are only useful when the main program is running, and it's okay to kill them off once the other non-daemon threads have exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Without daemon threads, we have to keep track of them, and tell them to exit, before our program can completerly quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By Setting them as daemon threads, we can let them run and forget about them, and when our program quits, any daemon threads are killed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually our main program implicitly waits until all other threads have completed their work. However, sometimes programs spawn a thread as a daemon that runs without blocking the main program from exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using daemon threads is useful for services where there may not be an easy way to interrupt the thread or where letting the thread die in the middle of its work without losing or currpting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To designate a thread as a daemon, we call its setDaemon() method with a boolean argument. The default setting for a threads is non-daemon. so, passing True turn the daemon mode on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also use the daemon argument set as True to make a thread as Daemon in the Thread() class."
